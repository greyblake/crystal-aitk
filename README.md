# aitk

Artificial Intelligence Tool Kit for Crystal programming language.


Currently it is just a sandbox, where I learn the AI algorithms based on
[Artificial Intelligence for Humans](http://www.heatonresearch.com/aifh/) books.

## So far implemented
* Clustering
  * K-meaning
* Radial basis functions network
* Optimization
  * [Nelder-Mead method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method)
  * Greedy Random Algorithm


## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aitk:
